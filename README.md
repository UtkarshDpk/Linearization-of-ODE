# Linearizarion of Ordinary Differential Equations
Linearization is the process of taking the gradient of a nonlinear function with respect to all variables and creating a linear representation at that point. It is required for certain types of analysis such as stability analysis, solution with a Laplace transform, and to put the model into linear state-space form.
This project shows Linearization of an Ordinary Differential Equation and determining the steady state to produce a planar linear model that represents the nonlinear model only at a certain point. We further simulate a Doublet Test (used to differentiate signals) with the nonlinear and linearized models to show the suitability of the linear model to represent the original nonlinear equation solution with small step changes.
